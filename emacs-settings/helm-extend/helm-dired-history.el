;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Someone like to reuse the current dired buffer to visit
;; another directory, so that you just need open one dired
;; buffer. but the bad point is ,you can't  easily go
;; forward and back in different dired directory. this file
;; can remember dired directory you have visited and list them
;; using `helm.el'.
